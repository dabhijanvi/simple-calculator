# ✨ Simple HTML Calculator Project ✨

This project is a basic calculator interface built entirely using HTML (and optionally styled with CSS). It's a static, non-functional layout that visually represents a calculator's structure — great for beginners learning how to organize elements on a page using HTML only.






## 🌟 Project Overview

🧮 Calculator Layout: Features number buttons (0–9), operators (+, −, ×, ÷), and a result/display area.<br>
🔢 Button Grid: Arranged in a typical calculator style using rows and columns for easy recognition.<br>
📺 Display Screen: A non-interactive display section to mimic output functionality.<br>
🚫 No JavaScript: This version is purely structural — no functionality or logic is included.<br>


## 🎨 Technology Used

✅ HTML5 – Used to create the layout and structure:<br>

<div> – For containers and layout blocks<br>

<button> – For calculator buttons<br>

<input> or <p> – For the display area (static only)<br>

(Optional) ✅ CSS – Can be added to style the calculator with:<br>

Grid/flex layout<br>

Button spacing and shadows<br>

Font and background customization<br>


## 🚀 Key Design Elements

✔️ Simple Layout: Clean, block-based structure that mimics a real calculator.<br>
✔️ Beginner-Friendly: Ideal for learning how to use HTML elements meaningfully.<br>
✔️ Customizable: Can later be enhanced with CSS styling or JavaScript functionality.<br>
✔️ Mobile Preview: While not responsive by default, it can be adapted easily.<br>


## 📈 Project Goal

To create a non-functional calculator UI using only HTML, providing a foundation for learning web layout basics. This project is perfect for beginners getting hands-on with structure and markup while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
